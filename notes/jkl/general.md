# root
Implement global processes (i.e. @ root)
- main site homepage
- distilled keywords percolated up
- some additional processing of the MegaText
  - wordclouds



# bottom-up again: 
- reextract keywords from the originals, and rerun the summary process with global-view context added in




# knowledge-base building
- generate an inverted index for keywords and topics distilled in the above top-down-bottom-up loops in all documents
- create summary pages that summarize the content and link to it. 



# user-defined process pipelines
- let users define the target file extensions (and compound extensions, e.g., .config.json)
